# Connecting Cloud SQL from Cloud Composer
## Create a Cloud Composer cluster (environment)
Before you start, make sure you have created and selected a GCP project to work with.

To create your Composer cluster, follow official instructions here.

This step can take several minutes, so I suggest you do this first, while we complete the initial steps. We will get back to it once the service it's up and running.

Behind the scenes, your Cloud Composer is running on a GKE cluster - to which you will connect in latter steps.
